# PHP - PRACTICE

This is my first step about learning PHP which is one of my goals this year. In this repository you will find all folders and files that I've developed to learn the basis of PHP. 

<br />

To run the PHP script, make sure to already run the local server of your computer. In my case, I use the following command to start it: 
```zsh
php -S localhost:8000
```
And secondly you can run the localhost:8000 in your own Browser.
